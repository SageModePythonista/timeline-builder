			"text": "<p>The history of artificial intelligence (AI) as a field is intertwined with the history of machine learning, as the algorithms and computational advances that underpin ML fed into the development of AI. It is useful to remember that, while these fields as distinct areas of inquiry began to crystallize in the 1950s, important algorithmic, statistical, mathematical, computational and technical discoveries predated and overlapped this era. In fact, people have been thinking about these questions for hundreds of years: this article discusses the historical intellectual underpinnings of the idea of a 'thinking machine.'</p>"

In 1967, Marvin Minsky stated confidently that \"Within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved.\" (Minsky, Marvin (1967), Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall) natural language processing research flourished, search was refined and made more powerful, and the concept of 'micro-worlds' was created, where simple tasks were completed using plain language instructions.</p>"

				"text": "As the field grew, its benefit to business became clearer, and in the 1980s so did the proliferation of 'expert systems'. \"Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software.\". This type of system is actually hybrid, consisting partially of a rules engine defining business requirements, and an inference engine that leveraged the rules system to deduce new facts. This era also saw increasing attention paid to neural networks."

				"text": "The proliferation of specialized expert systems hardware had the unfortunate effect of becoming too specialized. The rise of personal computers also competed with these large, specialized, centralized systems. The democratization of computing had begun, and it eventually paved the way for the modern explosion of big data."

				"headline": "A new era",
				"text": "This epoch saw a new era for ML and AI to be able to solve some of the problems that had been caused earlier by the lack of data and compute power. The amount of data began to rapidly increase and become more widely available, for better and for worse, especially with the advent of the smartphone around 2007. Compute power expanded exponentially, and algorithms evolved alongside. The field began to gain maturity as the freewheeling days of the past began to crystallize into a true discipline."

As Microsoft's Brad Smith has stated, \"Information technology raises issues that go to the heart of fundamental human-rights protections like privacy and freedom of expression. These issues heighten responsibility for tech companies that create these products. In our view, they also call for thoughtful government regulation and for the development of norms around acceptable uses\""
